/**
  * A version of UIExample that shows how you can host the UI in a different JVM to the
  *
  * For the case of this example, both are done in the same JVM. See comments for what goes in each JVM in practice.
  *
  * NOTE: Don't use this unless you *actually* need the UI to be hosted in a separate JVM for training.
  * For a single JVM, this approach will be slower than doing it the normal way
  *
  * To change the UI port (usually not necessary) - set the org.deeplearning4j.ui.port system property
  * i.e., run the example and pass the following to the JVM, to use port 9001: -Dorg.deeplearning4j.ui.port=9001
